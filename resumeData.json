    "bio":"In 2019 I decided to enroll myself into a software development bootcamp. Challenging as it may be for someone with no prior experience, I quickly found myself enjoying each topic and framework. Working in the restaurant industry has led me to develop desirable skills such as strong oral communication with team members, efficient use of time and thoughtful planning. I believe these skills can be translated in the tech field and easily make me a valuable pick.",
